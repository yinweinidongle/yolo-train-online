# Model Download Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Issue

Training tasks were failing with a network error when trying to download YOLO models from GitHub:

```
ProxyError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.github.com', port=443): 
Max retries exceeded... Unable to connect to proxy
```

## Root Cause

The YOLO library was trying to download model files from GitHub automatically, but the network request failed due to proxy/firewall/network issues.

## Solution Implemented

Updated `train_service.py` to **check for pre-downloaded models** in the `backend/models/` directory before attempting to download.

### Code Changes

The model loading logic now:

1. **Checks local models directory first**:
   ```python
   local_model_path = os.path.join(self.models_dir, model_file)
   if os.path.exists(local_model_path):
       model_path = local_model_path
       print(f"Using local model: {model_path}")
   ```

2. **Uses local model if available**: No download needed!

3. **Provides clear error message if download fails**: Tells user exactly what to do

### Your Pre-downloaded Models

You already have all the models ready in `backend/models/`:

‚úÖ **yolo11n.pt** (5.4 MB) - Nano (fastest)
‚úÖ **yolo11s.pt** (18.4 MB) - Small  
‚úÖ **yolo11m.pt** (38.8 MB) - Medium
‚úÖ **yolo11l.pt** (49 MB) - Large
‚úÖ **yolo11x.pt** (109 MB) - Extra Large

## How It Works Now

### Before (Failed):
```
1. Create training task
2. YOLO tries to download from GitHub ‚Üí FAILS with ProxyError
3. Training fails
```

### After (Works):
```
1. Create training task
2. Check backend/models/ for yolo11n.pt ‚Üí FOUND! ‚úì
3. Load local model ‚Üí SUCCESS!
4. Start training ‚Üí Works!
```

## Test It Now

### Step 1: Restart Backend
```bash
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python app.py
```

### Step 2: Create Training Task
- Dataset: "ÊùÇËçâËØÜÂà´1"
- Model: **yolo11n** (or any of s/m/l/x)
- Epochs: 2 (for quick test)
- Batch: 4
- Image size: 640

### Step 3: Check Console Output

You should see:
```
Starting training for task X...
Dataset path: E:\Codex\yolo-online\backend\datasets\...
Using local model: E:\Codex\yolo-online\backend\models\yolo11n.pt
Model loaded successfully!
Starting YOLO training...
```

## Expected Behavior

- ‚úÖ No more proxy errors
- ‚úÖ No downloading from GitHub  
- ‚úÖ Instant model loading
- ‚úÖ Training starts immediately

## Benefits

1. **Faster startup**: No waiting for downloads
2. **Works offline**: No internet needed for training
3. **No proxy issues**: Uses local files
4. **Predictable**: Same model version every time

## If You Need More Models

If you need classification or segmentation models:

**Classification models** (add to backend/models/):
- yolo11n-cls.pt
- yolo11s-cls.pt  
- yolo11m-cls.pt

**Segmentation models** (add to backend/models/):
- yolo11n-seg.pt
- yolo11s-seg.pt
- yolo11m-seg.pt

## Status

‚úÖ **FIXED** - The system now uses your pre-downloaded models from `backend/models/` directory.

No more network errors! Training should work immediately! üéâ
