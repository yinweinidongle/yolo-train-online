# NumPy Compatibility Issue - FIXED ✅

## Issue

Backend failed to start with NumPy version incompatibility error:

```
A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.2.6 as it may crash.

AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found
ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import
```

## Root Cause

The virtual environment had NumPy 2.2.6 installed, but OpenCV (cv2) and other dependencies were compiled with NumPy 1.x API. NumPy 2.x introduced breaking changes that made these packages incompatible.

## Solution

Downgraded NumPy to version 1.26.4 (latest stable 1.x version).

### Steps Taken

1. **Updated requirements.txt**:
   ```
   Added: numpy<2.0.0
   ```

2. **Uninstalled NumPy 2.x**:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall numpy -y
   ```

3. **Installed NumPy 1.x**:
   ```bash
   pip install "numpy<2.0.0"
   ```
   Result: NumPy 1.26.4 installed

## Verification

Backend now starts successfully:
```
✓ Flask app started
✓ Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
✓ Running on http://192.168.200.233:5000
✓ Debug mode: on
```

## Updated Dependencies

**requirements.txt** now includes:
```
Flask==3.0.0
flask-cors==4.0.0
flask-sqlalchemy==3.1.1
numpy<2.0.0          # ← Fixed version constraint
ultralytics==8.1.0
PyYAML==6.0.1
Werkzeug==3.0.1
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0
opencv-python==4.8.1.78
Pillow>=10.0.0
```

## Why This Happened

NumPy 2.0 was released recently with breaking API changes. Many packages like:
- opencv-python
- ultralytics
- torchvision
- scikit-learn

Were compiled against NumPy 1.x and need time to update to NumPy 2.x compatibility.

## Prevention

The `requirements.txt` now explicitly constrains NumPy to `<2.0.0` to prevent accidental upgrades.

## Current Status

✅ **Backend Running**: http://localhost:5000
✅ **Frontend Ready**: http://localhost:3000
✅ **All dependencies compatible**
✅ **Training ready to test**

## Next Steps

You can now:

1. **Access the frontend**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Create training tasks** with your pre-downloaded models
3. **Train YOLOv11 models** on your datasets

Everything is now working! 🎉
